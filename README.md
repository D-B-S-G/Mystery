MysteryHouse

The BSC space has exploded across Q1 and Q2 of 2021, with a plethora of new token launches per week. While some of these new projects were and are innovative, unique and legitimate, a majority of them turn out to be scams and rug pulls, effectively taking money from new investors that could have gone into real projects instead. The Spring/Summer cryptocurrency downtrend has accentuated this phenomenon. It it so problematic that in response we have decided to launch the whole concept of Mystery House.

Mystery House is a multi-utility coin that will keep on giving! The first utility will be a SAFU Launchpad that will be going online in August 2021. Using our proprietary technology, the launchpad will offer advantages to token holders by allowing them early access to new coin launches. You will need to HOLD mystery house tokens to participate in any coins or tokens that are released through the launchpad.

Mystery House will contain many sub-utilities :
- Mystery Launchpad 
- Coin Interchange
- Merchandise
- Tracking and chart tools
- Casino games

A safe environment where coins are heavily vetted before launch and launch is assisted by us in order to ensure that there is no stealing of money right at launch.
Mystery Coins are a family of tokens where each member of the family has different tokenomics that also interlink. This ensures that that when any coin moons, all the other family coins will start to moon as well.
By holding Mystery House you will be able to get into any new launch right at launch, plus be able to use your Mystery House to play casino games, pay for merchandise, and more!

As the project expands, we will develop a coin interchange that will allow you change your mystery coins for a low tax fee. We also plan to launch a merchandise shop selling things like t-shirts, keychains and caps, a tracking and charting tools website and casino games!
